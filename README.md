# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data like stock prices.

## Overview

This project uses LSTMs to predict future stock prices based on historical data.  LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them effective for capturing trends and patterns in stock market data.  The model is trained on historical stock data and can then be used to predict future prices.

## Features

* **LSTM Network:**  Implements a stock price prediction model using LSTM layers.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, scaling) to prepare the stock data for the LSTM network.
* **Training and Evaluation:**  Provides scripts for training the LSTM model and evaluating its performance.
* **Visualization:**  *(If implemented)* Includes visualizations of the predicted stock prices compared to the actual prices.
* **[Other Features]:**  List any other relevant features of your project.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **TensorFlow or Keras:** The deep learning framework used.
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow  # Or pip install keras if using Keras directly

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
Stock Data: You'll need historical stock data. (Explain how to obtain the data, e.g., using yfinance, a CSV file, or a specific API.)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/Stock_Predictor_Using_LSTM.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/Stock_Predictor_Using_LSTM.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd Stock_Predictor_Using_LSTM
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Code
Data Preparation:  Prepare your stock data. (Provide detailed instructions on how to do this.  This is a critical step.)

Training:

Bash

python train.py  # Replace train.py with the name of your training script
(Explain the training parameters, epochs, batch size, etc.)

Prediction:

Bash

python predict.py  # Replace predict.py with the name of your prediction script
Evaluation: (If implemented)

Bash

python evaluate.py  # Replace evaluate.py with the name of your evaluation script
Data
(Explain the data used in your project, including:)

Stock Ticker: (e.g., AAPL, GOOG)
Data Source: (e.g., Yahoo Finance, a specific API)
Time Period: (e.g., the date range of the historical data)
Features Used: (e.g., Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume)
Model Architecture
(Describe the architecture of your LSTM model.  This should include:)

Number of LSTM layers:
Number of neurons per layer:
Other layers: (e.g., Dense layers, Dropout layers)
Activation functions:
Optimizer:
Loss function:
Results
(Include the results of your model's performance.  This could include:)

Metrics: (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error)
Visualizations: (e.g., plots of predicted vs. actual prices)
Important Considerations
Stock market prediction is inherently difficult. Past performance is not indicative of future results. This project is for educational purposes and should not be used for actual investment decisions.
Hyperparameter tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, neurons, learning rate) to optimize model performance.
Feature engineering: Explore adding more features (e.g., technical indicators) to potentially improve predictions.

Key improvements:

* **Clear Structure:**  The README is well-organized with clear headings.
* **Comprehensive Information:**  It covers essential aspects like prerequisites, installation, running the code, data used, model architecture, results, and important considerations.
* **Emphasis on Data Preparation:**  Highlights the crucial step of data preparation.
* **Model Architecture Details:**  Encourages describing the model architecture in detail.
* **Important Considerations:**  Includes a disclaimer about the difficulty of stock prediction and emphasizes that the project is for educational purposes.
* **Contact Information:** Includes contact information.

Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with your project's specific information.  The "Data" and "Model Architecture" sections are particularly important for this type of project.  Be sure to explain the data preparation steps clearly, as this is often the most challenging part of working with time-series data.
